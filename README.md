# Speech_Recognittion_project
This Python code captures 3 seconds of audio from the user's microphone, converts it to text using Google Speech Recognition, and prints the transcribed text. It then generates an MP3 audio file of the text using gTTS and saves it as 'the_text.mp3'. Finally, it plays the audio using the default media player.
